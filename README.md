# Distinct Modes of Class Fitting in Residual Networks

This repository will contain the code for the paper *Neural Representations Reveal Distinct Modes of Class Fitting in Residual Convolutional Networks*, accepted at the AAAI-23 conference.

The extended version of the paper, including technical appendix and initial results for non-convolutional architectures with skip-connections (Vision Transformers and MLP Mixers) is available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00771
